    My most profound psych experiances. If you don't have anything to believe in, kick it up a notch until you die, or you do: 1 An explanation of my findings regarding to the basics of psychedelics, those basics namely being the study of Interdimensional
    entity's in and around their involvement with psychedelics and even this world. Including an interlaced narrative: 2 How and why I used psychedelics to find interdimensional entity's and the things they told me. Why I was going to kill myself, and
    why why I didn't. ------------------------------------------------------------------o0o--------------------------------------------------------------------- The Earliest Memory i Have Of Hearing This Call: Elementary school. I was sitting in class
    and wondering why these people were teaching me about the sciences of the universe, instead of where it came from, or atleast explaining theories. So I decided that I would not end up one of them. Brainwashed by this school system that prides itself
    in understanding the smaller picture. I decided to dedicate my life to finding out where this all came from, and not to let fallible man teach me, I wanted to let something else teach me, something I could trust, How could i find out on my own? I
    began wondering who I could reach out to help me on my philosophical journey. "Perhaps aliens", I thought. But what are the chances I would ever meet or talk to an alian. So I decided to do my research on inter-dimensional aliens. When I got a computer
    around the age of 14 I noticed that on psychedelics people are having experiences with interdimensional entity's. For instance, I even read a dmt trip report, that described an entity which a separate trip report had a painting of. ----o0o----------------
    First Opportunity to Do Acid: Around 11th grade I run into an old acquaintance at lunch time in school. He had just transferred. I had met him briefly, a couple years before, and from that encounter knew him to be into drugs. He calls my name "Are
    you ****"? Thinking about my privacy and how I like to lay low from strangers, I say, no. But then I recognize him and say "yes", we catch up and agree to take some of his acid the next day. I invited him to spend the fallowing night with me at my
    house. We both took 1.5 tabs of quality sourced acid. I couldn't even begin to describe what I saw and felt for those 9ish hours. The fallowing section recounts three experiences. One from Acid, one from dmt, and then one on dxm and coincidences.
    Then we move on to the meat and potatoes. Acid: We spent a little bit of time walking through my downtown area, where we peaked. The first thing I noticed was what we call "headspace", where you begin feeling extremely in control of your mind because
    the atmosphere in there is a lot larger. Hence, head-"space". I also noticed that my judgment (thoughts) increased considerably, as if to learn many years worth of lessons in a few hours. I began having dozens of revelations on how to act wisely in
    my dealings with other people. My body and mind felt smoother in operation, and almost as lush as my surroundings looked. I knew that I was hooked and didn't feel bad about it either because it is the second safest psychedelic, following dmt and It
    doesn't have a high and then a low, like most other drugs and all other stimulants. on the contrary it had what we called an "after-glow", where you feel amazing the fallowing days. ----o0o---------------- Dmt, The First Time I Communicated In Clarity
    So my short term goal in life was to do dmt, and eventually I ordered it and and broke through. I will now explain that experience, it being my only time breaking through, with re-doses to keep the experience longer. I sat in my bed and took the hits
    of the substance which had the appearance of tea, dmt. I was hardly ever left alone in my house, but this was a rare occasion in which i was. I didn't know when they would come back, but figured if they did I would be fine as I always am on psychs.
    After all it takes only 20 mins to run its course. I hear the seemingly universal sound and my vision begins to be replaced with what looks like another dimension. A being appears Infront of me with a question mark above his head. There are no thoughts
    in my mind beside the ones I decide to think, so i think: "I come in peace". It gets written down Infront of me in a Zelda 2 text box, then disappears as he receives it. Another two beings appear next to him, to his top right and top left. They communicated
    in English telepathically, and with symbols above their heads. Hashtags, explanation marks, sad faces, and happy faces. I then say "Do you guys know where existence came from? Then the main one said "no". Then i say "It's most likely a simulation,
    right?" Then it said "Most likely". He then takes me to this machine that they build that's supposed to examine where existence came from. I told him the dmt was wearing off, he said smoke more, so i was able to extend the trip for another 10 minutes
    or so. I asked them how many visitors they get and what they do for fun, that's it. If I recall correctly he said none, and then he took me to a place where they race for fun. That's the only small talk I made, the rest was just observing their dimension.
    I couldnt move about, only the main being I was with could take me to different planes of the dimension. I got out of the trip, called my friend to tell him what happened, he said he was happy for me, but I had doubts about the legitimacy about the
    experience. I was doubtful about this because the dimension I went to looks just like what -->I
    <-- thought a dimension would look like. It was composed of deep dark space, neon purple lines creating objects, instantaneous movement, etc. Nonetheless, I knew the entity 's were real because.. well that was just
        obvious. You know if you' ve met someone, don 't you? ----o0o---------------- Dissociatives Causing Coincidences:
        I was intrigued with dxm because taking it causes coincidences to happen. Ive seen one outside source on this. I
        will give an example of the most prominent one that happened to me. The story will start out talking about a
        mushroom trip, but it' s all relevant. I wasn 't happy with the potency of my mushroom trip so i decided to smoke
        weed which amplifies the affects. After dosing a gram of weed I experienced a phenomenon
        called "depersonalization" Which has many manifestations, but usually causes people feel like they are an actor
        in a tv show, or movie. There are other manifestations, too. Like the one that happened to me after taking the
        weed. This time I saw that I was on a platform in the circus. Like I was a clown. Here' s where the coincidence starts. The very next day i was at work at pizza hut and someone called to place an order. This is exactly how the conversation went.
        Nothing left out. I pick up the phone: caller: "what is your name" ? "****" "Okay, I will come place my order" *hangs up* A Muslim man arrives and asks for me and says only these three things, literally one after the other. Nothing about a pizza until
        after these three things. "How's your car doing?" A coincidence because I had JUST gotten my first car and it needed some work. "maybe well go shooting sometime" A coincidence because I have gone shooting in the past every time I go to the mountains.
        and three, "Maybe we'll go to the circus sometime, ---> but only after smoking a little weed" . <--- My jaw drops. I knew this stuff caused coincidences, but not like that I will add one more coincidence. I never watch(ed) 16 and pregnant, but I decided
        to put it on one day. The next day I saw, what I believe, was that same couple at my local CVS. Obviously this one is unproveable, even to myself because I did 'nt ask them.
        ----o0o---------------- Meeting the Beings Responsible for Such Coincidences, and Other Psychedelic Phenomena:
        The orchestration of coincidences, visuals, and revelation requires a designer, and I knew it wasn' t me, so a a couple days after that coincidence ni pizza hut I decided to go to a field on mushrooms. I looked up into the sky and said
        "gods of drugs, I know that you're real, please reveal yourselves to me" . I felt a presence high in the sky and he said telepathically, "we are real and we will reveal ourselves to you soon" . ----o0o---------------- Meeting the god of Weed: The next day I hit a bowl of weed once and a white orb fly 's up
        to me. "I am the god of weed, we know that you know that we exist" So I
        say, "can you prove that you' re the god of weed " ? " you want a visual? " To which I reply, " sure " , he
        said " here you go " and I saw a little visual. It was a machine that produced a hologram of a field (my favorite
        landscape). Just the fact that he spoke to me that he was going to do it and then he did was proof enough. I
        then noticed that he had a whip in his hand, it was rainbow colored and he began whipping me. I got the
        impression that he was mad at me because I knew I shouldn't have been smoking weed because it wasn't good for
        me, but was addicted to it nonetheless. He says to
        me, " Now that you know that we are real you get to meet the god of each class of drugs and choose which one to worship for your whole life, and you will do his drug (a lot). When you die they will decide whether you will go to their heaven
        or their hell. "
        At that point I got VERY scared because now hell was in the equation. ----o0o---------------- Meeting the god of
        Dissociatives: The next day I decide to meet the god of dissociatives, so i took some dxm. I feel a presence
        with me at my desk and he speaks to me to go downstairs and get my little sister. He wants me to bring her
        upstairs to watch Rick and Morty with me. I didn't want to because she was quite young, but he said that if i
        don't he will put cockroaches on my legs and I began feeling them, so I did. I alsofelt that this was also the
        god of coincidences, hence all the coincidences from taking dissociatives. ----o0o---------------- Meeting with
        the god of acid: Laying down, meditating on acid, wondering about this next meeting, I hear familiar voices
        saying: " f*ck it, this kid wants to know, lets just show him, f*ck it. "
        Meaning " This kid wants to know where existence came from so bad, f*ck it Lets just show him. " . I saw the roof
        of my house and began zooming out through space. I pass earth and then pass entire galaxy's. In-between each I
        distinctly felt the affect of every drug I had ever done. I fly out of a white ball with a stick underneath. The
        stick was being held by a being whose body is the shape of a box . Coming out of the box was his long neck that
        had arms extending from it which held up the stick. The ball I flew out of was floating on top of the stick. He
        had a mustache on his face, and eyes that were cylindrically aimed towards the ball with the eyeballs on either
        end. r/Psychonaut - My most profound psych experiances. The only thing I left out of the picture was a handlebar
        mustache on his neck. The skin of this thing was beige, like human skin. He noticed me and sprung his head out
        at me and said " Y 'know that theory you heard the other day about the nature of existence" ? I said "yes" , he
        said "its true" . The theory he was talking about is from Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, here' s an excerpt about it, taken from (1) if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear
        and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened. Then he vanished. ----o0o---------------- One last shot at hope: I was devastated. I decided to run a test and see
        if I could disprove what just happened. Assuming that it was the god of acid and it was responsible for acid trips, I figured that If I could receive deep visuals and revelation from acid then maybe that being was just joking with me. I saved my tolerance
        for a week and took 14 hits of the best acid I had ever had. Nothing. I did have wavy visuals, but not my usual revelations and designed visuals. This was really pure acid, too. ----o0o---------------- Hope Deferred Indefinitely: The next day at work
        I am washing dishes and a feeling comes over me that I needed to kill myself. I couldn 't argue it. Did I want to
        argue it? Absolutely. But no argument could be made on my behalf. Not after what I had just witnessed. People
        who want to kill themselves don' t WANT to feel like that, they have no say in the matter. Don 't you think
        everyone wants to be happy and enjoy life? Suicide is a demon, not a human. That being said the only thing' s I enjoyed during life was skateboarding and philosophy. I had gotten to the end of philosophy and I couldn 't
        skateboard anymore do to horrific knee injuries. I drive home weeping and stop by my friends house, he' s home, but no match against an existential crisis. He calls our friend and he comes over right away, I didn 't even
        bother explaining what happened, It was already sure to me. He tried his best but I left defeated. I then stop
        by my third friends house. He isn' t home, but when his mom tells me that he isn 't there I break down on his
        porch in front of her. She invites me in, calls my friend and I tell her everything that happened, she had no
        wisdom to give whatsoever. I saw my friend pull into his neighborhood on my way out. When home as a last ditch
        effort to find a reason to live I google "what happens when you die" but I am crying too hard to pay any
        attention to the answers. I know that the next morning I' m going to drive downtown, go to the top of a parking deck, and jump off. I like the idea of enjoying one of my favorite "fun" drugs before I leave, but I have too little emotional drive
        to boot up (2)tails so I place an order on a fake sight in chrome using windows. I put my face in my pillow, and weeping, I say outload, "I just want to know why existence is here" . ---o0o--- Salvation: Suddenly I felt two eyes looking at me from
        behind my head and felt him smiling at me. This being was not like the ones I had met before. This being was something entirely different. I felt so much love and understanding come off of Him, so much understanding that I knew he was God! So much
        understanding that He understood everything in all of existence and everything prior. I know I 'm being saved, and I know who does the
        saving, but with a grin on my face, I ask: "Are you Jesus Christ" ? "Yes." To which I replied "I love you" He
        didn' t need to say it because I knew that He did, but He said "I love you, too" . Then he downloaded me with the knowledge of the nature of existence. Nothing that the average Christian doesn 't know: mainly that God created
        all of this: Genesis 1:1 - In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." He revealed to me that the
        beings I was talking to were angels that left heaven because they believed the devil, and not even in the
        fullness of glory was God not even enough for them: Revelation 12:7-9
        - "The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him"
        . He showed me how God made the earth for the purpose of life: 1 John 1:3
        - "All things were made by Him, and without him nothing was made that was made. In Him was Life, and that Life was the light of men."
        Yet since we rebelled and God is just, justice had to be enacted - death: Romans
        5:12: "Just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin..." Yet God is not willing that any
        of his beloved creation should go to hell 2 Peter
        3:10: "God is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" , So God set forth a
        plan from before He created eternity: Revelation 13:8 "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." I.e the
        atoning sacrifice for an eternity' s worth of sin and justification. He himself would dwell among us: 1 John 1:1 -
        "The Life appeared, and we have seen and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us." He himself wiped our slate clean, by being slain on our behalf on the cross Hebrews 8:12, "I will forgive their wickedness, and will remember their sins no more." God, Being the one who is eternally perfect, is the only candidate to be the one to
        bear the penalty for an eternities worth of sin: 2 Cor. 5:21.- God made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God. " Then
        I said " can i have the Holy Spirit? " and I felt a white orb fly into my stomach: John 7:38
        - " Whoever believes in Me (Jesus) Out of His Belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water, " but this He spake of the
        Spirit who was yet to be given, because Christ was not yet crucified." When The Holy Spirit entered me I felt my spirit get born John 3:3, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." Your recreated
        human spirit is the part of you that must be born again. Once you are born again your spirit is now one spirit with the Lord: 1 Cor. 6:17 - "The one who is united and joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him." Jesus speaking to Nicodemus in John
        3:6 Says this: - "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." A short time later that night Jesus head flew into the Orb (The Holy Spirit): Colossians 1:18 - "He is the head of the body, the church."
        I sat in my room all night with Jesus, and not one iota of condemnation came off of him. Romans 8:1. "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" I could have asked Him any question that I wanted to, but I knew I had
        just met the answer to any question I had. John 14:6 "I AM the Way, The Truth, and The Life, No one comes unto the Father but by me" . Thank you Father , I pray now for all of these that would read this, that their spirits would be united to the Spirit
        of the Lord and washed clean in the Blood of the Lamb. -------------------------------------------------------------oo0oo----------------------------------------------------------- (1) https://bookriot.com/the-42-best-lines-from-douglas-adams-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-series/#:~:text=1.,even%20more%20bizarre%20and%20inexplicable
